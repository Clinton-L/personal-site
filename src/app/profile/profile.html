  <p>
    I am a software developer with a passion for creating innovative solutions and a strong focus on web development. <br />
    With over 7 years of experience in the industry, I have honed my skills in various technologies and frameworks, including C#, .NET, SQL, HTML, JavaScript, jQuery, REACT, and TypeScript. <br />
    My journey has been marked by continuous learning and growth, both technically and in leadership roles.
  </p>
  <p>
    Over the last 7 and a half years I have been working at <a href="https://inlogik.com/">Inlogik</a> where I began as a Mid level developer. <br />
    In this time I have been able to grow my skills and knowledge in the field of software development, a strong focus technically in <br />
    <b>C#, .Net, SQL, HTML, JavaScript, jQuery, REACT and TypeScript</b>. <br />
    But also in the field of <b>project management, team leadership and mentoring</b>. <br />

  <p>
    With a strong focus on the development of web applications, working on a variety of projects, from small internal tools to large scale feature implementation on a Monolithic project. <br />
    I have been able to lead a team of developers and testers, providing guidance and support to help them achieve a high standard of work thats inline with not only the companies goals but theirs and mine. <br />
    From mentoring junior developers to other mid level developers and even multiple teams at once, I have been able to help them grow their skills and knowledge. <br />
    Always adhering to and showing them best practices, architectural patterns and principals, to the best of my abilities. <br />
  </p>

  <p>
    However the biggest challenges I have faced have been in the field of team leadership and mentoring. <br />
    It hasn't all been smooth sailing, I have faced some truly unpleasent choices along the way, from tight deadlines where the candle had burnt out many nights to complex technical issues that I had to say I couldn't solve. <br />
    But the most difficult challenges are the hard conversations with team members, where I have had to provide feedback that was not well received, or when I have had to let someone go. <br />
    These experiences have taught me the importance of empathy, communication and understanding in leadership. <br />
    I have learned that being a good leader is not just about technical skills, but also about being able to connect with people, to understand their needs and to support them in their growth. <br />
    I strive to create an environment where everyone feels valued and supported, where they can learn and grow, and where they can achieve their goals. <br />
    Through setting clear expectations, providing regular feedback and support, and being open to feedback myself, I have been able to create a positive and productive team culture. <br />
