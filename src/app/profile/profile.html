      I am a software developer with a passion for creating innovative solutions and a strong focus on web development. <br />
      With over 7 years of experience in the industry, I have honed my skills in various technologies and frameworks. <br />
      This includes C#, .NET, SQL, HTML, JavaScript, jQuery, REACT, and TypeScript. <br />
      My journey has been marked by continuous learning and growth, both technically and in leadership roles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the last 7 and a half years I have been working at <a href="https://inlogik.com/">Inlogik</a>. <br />
      In this time I have been able to grow my skills and knowledge in the field of software development, a strong focus technically in <br />
      <b>C#, .Net, SQL, HTML, JavaScript, jQuery, REACT and TypeScript</b>. <br />
      But also in the field of <b>project management, team leadership and mentoring</b>. <br />

    <p>
      With a strong focus on web applications development, I have been working on a variety of projects, <br />
      from small internal tools to large scale feature implementations on a Monolithic project. <br />
      <br />
      I lead a team of developers and testers providing guidance, support and feedback to help them achieve a high standard of work. <br />
      Importantly ensuring that it is inline with not only the companies goals but theirs and mine. <br />
      From mentoring developers (Junior -Mid level) and even multiple teams at once, I have been able to help them grow their skills and knowledge. <br />
      Always adhering to and showing them best practices, architectural patterns and principals, to the best of my abilities. <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      However the biggest challenges I have faced have been in the field of team leadership and mentoring. <br />
      It hasn't all been smooth sailing, facing some truly unpleasent choices along the way. From tight deadlines where the candle had burnt out many nights, <br />
      to complex technical issues that I had to say I couldn't solve. <br />
      But the most difficult challenges are the hard conversations with team members, providing feedback that was not well received, or their dismissal. <br />
      These experiences have taught me the importance of empathy, communication and understanding in leadership. <br />
      Being a good leader is not just about technical skills, but the ability to connect, to understand needs and to support them in their growth. <br />
      I strive to create an environment where all feel valued, supported, where they can learn and grow, and where they can achieve their goals. <br />
      Through setting clear expectations, providing regular feedback and support, and being open to feedback myself,  <br />
      I have been able to create a positive and productive team culture. <br />
